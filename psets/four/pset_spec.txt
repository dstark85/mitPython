Two versions of a wordgame will be made.
This game resembles scrabble
Players will be dealt letters and then construct words.
Each successfully created word will return a score. 
Players are dealt n letters (assume 7 for now)
The player arranges the hand into as many words as they can.
 Each letter can only be used once, however.
Scoring:
  word score is sum of letter points multiplied by word length.
  Scrabble letter scoring is used: A = 1, B = 3 ...
  Each letter is mapped in SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES lowercase
Be Sure to validate that the hand actually contains the letters 
  that the user supplied via the word. Perhaps a try-exception
+50pt bonus for using all letters
