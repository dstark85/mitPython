def closest_power(base, num):
    '''
    base: base of the expoenential, integer > 1
    num: number you want to be closest to, integer > 0
    Find the integer exponent such that base ** exp is closest to num
    Note that the base ** exp may either be greater or less than num
    In case of a tie, return the smaller value
